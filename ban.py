# A simple python script that allows user to change Bandit level by running this instead of having to manually change the Bandit level each time. Now instead of holding back arrow for 3 seconds and hitting three keys, I can type out a command. yay.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Imports "os" which allows ban.py to use the os.system command below to output the text into bash.
import os

# Asking the user which Bandit level they want to SSH into and putting their answer into the "num" variable.
num = input("Which Bandit level would you like to access?")

# "bannum" (short for bandit number) is a variable that stores the first part of the string, appends the "num" variable, and then appends the second part of the string.
bannum = ("ssh bandit" + num + "@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220")

# os.system takes the "bannum" variable and outputs it into a shell command. Reduntant comment :).
os.system(bannum)
